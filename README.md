# PyTorch Template for Deep Learning in Remote Sensing

A flexible template for setting up deep learning experiments with pytorch and hydra.

* [ ] Command to start container
* [ ] How to run training
* `python3 model.py`: run an empty batch through the model and get the output shape. Useful for model testing and debugging.
* `python3 dataset.py`: load dataset with default config and get shape of first dataset element. Useful for debugging.
* `python3 main.py`: Main entry point for training.
